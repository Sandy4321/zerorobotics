ZeroRobotics
============

DevilTech Engineering's satellite controller source code for ZeroRobotics tourna
ments. Written in C++. Principal software engineers include Jerry Ma and Albert Hwang.

Warning -- code is poorly formatted and commented due to the rapid development
cycle necessitated by the competition structure. In addition, some structural
issues were caused by the transition from IDE to plain source code.

2011 Competition
----------------

In the 2011 ZeroRobotics international tournament, the task was to extract
energy from asteroids and quickly deliver it to a station via docking. DevilTech
Engineering earned 5th place aboard the International Space Station as an
alliance captain in its rookie year.

2012 Competition
----------------

In the 2012 ZeroRobotics international tournament, competitors were to perform
debris removal and navigate through gravitational obstacle fields. In just its
second year of competing, DevilTech Engineering earned a second-place
nationwide finish aboard the International Space Station against an initial
field of around 100 teams.
