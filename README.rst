DevilTech Engineering's satellite controller source code for ZeroRobotics tournaments. Written in C++. Principal
software engineers include Jerry Ma and Albert Hwang.

Warning -- code is poorly commented due to the rapid development cycle necessitated by the competition structure.

2011 Competition
----------------

In the 2011 ZeroRobotics international tournament, the task was to extract energy from asteroids and quickly
deliver it to a station via docking. DevilTech Engineering earned 5th place aboard the International Space
Station as an alliance captain in its rookie year.

2012 Competition
----------------

In the 2012 ZeroRobotics international tournament, competitors were to perform debris removal and navigate through
gravitational obstacle fields. In just its second year of competing, DevilTech Engineering earned a second-place
nationwide finish aboard the International Space Station against an initial field of around 100 teams.
